This is the *Desktop Connect Four* project I made myself.


The program is a graphical user interface (GUI) implementation of the Connect Four game. It extends the JFrame class and implements the ActionListener interface to handle button clicks. The game board is displayed in a GridLayout, with buttons representing the cells of the board. The game logic is implemented using a 2D char array that represents the state of the game board.

The program initializes the game board, sets up the GUI, and handles user input by updating the state of the game board and checking for a win condition. If a win is detected, the program highlights the winning pieces and displays a message dialog indicating the winner. The program also includes a reset button that clears the game board and resets the game to its initial state.
